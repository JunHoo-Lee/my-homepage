I'm a PhD student in computer vision and machine learning. I need you to find the most relevant and trending papers/discussions for me.

## Target Research Groups & Labs
- Kaiming He (Meta FAIR)
- Stefano Ermon (Stanford)
- ByteDance Research (CV/GenAI teams)
- Meta AI / FAIR
- Google DeepMind
- OpenAI Research
- DeepSeek-AI

## Research Topics
- Model attribution / fingerprinting (especially for generative models)
- Video understanding and summarization
- Layered video editing / video decomposition
- Diffusion language models (discrete diffusion for text)
- RLVR (Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards)
- Mean flow (flow matching, rectified flow)
- JiT / "Back to basics" vision transformers
- Value models for LLM alignment
- SSI (Safe Superintelligence) / AI safety

## Paper/Content Preferences
1. **Viral & Trending**: I heavily value what is currently trending on **X (Twitter)**. If a paper is being discussed by top researchers, I want to know about it, regardless of venue.
2. **First-Principles**: I prefer papers that challenge "complexity = better". Simpler methods that win are best.
3. **Recent ArXiv**: Un-published preprints are fine (and expected) if they are high impact or viral.

## Search Strategy
- You MUST prioritize "Recent" items.
- Check for "Accepted to [Top Venue]" announcements on X.
- Look for "Thread by [Author]" discussions.
