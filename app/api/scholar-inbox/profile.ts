I'm a PhD student in computer vision and machine learning. Recommend recent papers (2024-2025) that are trending on X/Twitter and match my research interests.

## Research Topics
- Model attribution / fingerprinting (especially for generative models)
- Video understanding and summarization
- Layered video editing / video decomposition
- Diffusion language models (discrete diffusion for text)
- RLVR (Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards)
- Mean flow (flow matching, rectified flow)
- JiT / "Back to basics" vision transformers
- Value models for LLM alignment
- SSI (Safe Superintelligence) / AI safety

## Groups & Researchers I Follow
- Kaiming He (Meta FAIR)
- Stefano Ermon (Stanford)

## Paper Style Preferences
I strongly prefer papers that:
1. Challenge the "more complexity = better" assumption
2. Show simpler methods outperform complex ones
3. Remove human priors and let models learn from data itself
4. Take a first-principles approach
5. Are viral/trending on ML Twitter/X
6. Published at top venues (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, CVPR, ECCV, ICCV) or high-impact arXiv preprints

## Output Format
For each paper, provide:
- Title
- Authors & affiliation
- One-line summary
- Why it matches my interests
- Link (arXiv or conference)
